<p>Web design has been an interest to each and everyone taking a technology course. All of them have been struggling to atleast get to learn and know how to design a basic website by knowing the basic website design techniques and codes. Moreover, to be an excellent web designer and building the smartest website, you need to start from somewhere.
<p> I therefore would not wish to be left behind and take that step and begin my web design career here by designing this simple website about me.</p>
<p>This is a simple website that i have created to basically talk and tell more about myself. It is kind of my curriculum vitae(CV) website</p>
